            <h4>Hi, I'm John Muthoga</h4>
            <p>
              As a passionate developer with expertise in Django, JavaScript,
              and SQL, I thrive on creating dynamic and user-friendly web
              applications. My journey in software development is driven by a
              relentless curiosity and a commitment to excellence. I take pride
              in writing clean, maintainable code and enjoy collaborating with
              teams to bring innovative solutions to life. Whether streamlining
              business processes or enhancing user experiences, I am dedicated
              to leveraging technology to make a meaningful impact. I am excited
              to continue growing and tackling new challenges in the
              ever-evolving tech landscape.

            <hr />
            <p>
              My journey as a developer began with creating my personal
              portfolio using Django, which ignited my passion for web
              development. This project laid the foundation for my expertise in
              Django, and I am committed to writing efficient, maintainable
              code. I enjoy developing interactive, user-centric applications
              and thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to
              innovative solutions. With a strong drive for learning and
              improvement, I am excited to continue growing and tackling new
              challenges in the tech industry.

                  Designed, built and managed a lab management system as a sole
                  developer. System supported thousands of customers with UI for
                  lab Admins and customer dashboard.

                  Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, React, and

                <p>
                  I can learn just about anything by having a final product to
                  tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I needed to
                  figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is
                  just a reference.

                  After almost two years of supporting my system at the same lap
                  I'm ready to learn something now. I'll be collaborating and
                  sharing my experiences with others on my blog.

                  Aside from building small projects, I would love to enter a
                  position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from
                  others with more experience than myself.
